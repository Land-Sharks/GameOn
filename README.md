# GameOn

GameOn is a web application that is intended to be used by gamers- whether
they play casually, endlessly, or anywhere in between. The purpose for this website is
to be able to connect with other gamers to make friends and communities within the
games, while also allowing people to showcase their gaming achievements.Users will
be able to create user profiles, follow any number of games, get matched to other users
with a similar selection of followed games, and even create communities where they
can socialize and interact with each other. With this app, we hope to take the stress out
of finding communities surrounding niche games that have not gained a huge amount of
popularity, and give them a second shot at life.
